# 🕶️ Obscura | The Ethical Browser for a New Web

> “Your identity is yours. Your choices are yours. Your freedom starts here.”

Obscura is a privacy-first, open-source browser concept built for ethical anonymity. Designed for activists, journalists, researchers, and truth-seekers, Obscura combines cyberpunk design with crypto-grade security—and invites users to govern their own experience.
